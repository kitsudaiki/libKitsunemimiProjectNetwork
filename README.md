# libKitsuneProjectCommon

## Description

WIP: this repo should contain all functionality, which is necessary in all my specific projects. Its not in a usable state at the moment.

For now it contains the beginning of a simple data transfer protocol created by myself. I need something like this for my projects, which consist of multiple programs, which should interact wiht each other. It partially contains and as next should contain the following:

- Session-handling (init, resume, end)
- Heartbeat-Message
- Error-Messages
- Data transfer messages (single part and multi part messages (with pause, abort and resume))
